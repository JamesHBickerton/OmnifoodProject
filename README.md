# HTML & CSS Project - Omnifood Project UDEMY Course (Jonas Schmedtmann) 

Welcome to my HTML and CSS project! This was completed as part of a 37.5-hour course, where I developed a fully responsive website using modern web development techniques. This project represents my progress in learning web development fundamentals (with a slight introduction to Javascript). 

## Features of the Project
- **HTML**: Comprehensive use of semantic HTML to structure the content.
- **CSS**: Mastery of styling with CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, as well as responsiveness for all device sizes.
- **Basic JavaScript**: Incorporated a touch of JavaScript to enhance interactivity.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimised for viewing on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## What I Learned
Working on this project was a thoroughly enjoyable experience! It solidified my understanding of many key web development concepts and highlighted areas where I need to continue improving my learning and understanding. 

## Areas for Improvement/Continued Learning

1. **Flexbox**: Explore advanced techniques for layout and positioning.
2. **CSS Grid**: Enhance my proficiency in creating complex grid-based designs - this is now getting much easier and I am preferring this more to flexbox. 
3. **Positioning**: Deepen my understanding of absolute, relative and fixed positioning concepts. 
4. **Transform/Translate Properties**: Learn to apply these for animations and interactive effects.
5. **Box Model**: Refine my understanding of how elements are structured and spaced.
6. **Line Height**: Get more comfortable with fine-tuning text spacing.
7. **Max-Width Property**: Practice creating scalable and well-structured layouts.
8. **Pseudo-Selectors**: Experiment with `::before`, `::after`, and `:not` for styling flexibility.
9. **Margin-Top: Auto Trick**: Master this technique for precise positioning in Flexbox layouts.

## Future Plans
As I continue my journey, I plan to:
- Create more challenging projects to reinforce my skills.
- Experiment with animations and transitions to make websites more engaging.
- Dive deeper into JavaScript and start integrating more functionality into my projects.

I look forward to sharing my progress as I grow in my web development journey.
